# Empty Horizons a GTNH Challenge Mod

Most dimensions have been over taken by a poisonous fog. Spending too much time in it results in death from exposure. Challenge players start in a new dimension, the Empty Dimension, and must make excursions into the overworld to gather resources. Completing quests and achievements increases the amount of time players can spend in the fog.

### Features

- Allows players to choose if they want to participate in the challenge, choosing no results in a vanilla GTNH experience.
- A custom starting dimension for challenge players.
- An expedition block for traveling into the overworld.
- Randomly generated fog color and density for other lethal dimensions.
- Practically all options are changable in the config.

### Commands
- `/eh_chapterMultipliers`: Lists all chapter multipliers. (This is less useful now that the BetterQuesting integration has been added)
- `/eh_movetoparty`: Teleports the player to their chosen team member. This is a one time teleport. Due to how BetterQuesting syncing works with time rewards, its recommended to only form a party to group together then leave the party for the best experience.
- `/eh_recalcTime`: Recalculates the provided players max exposure time. Useful for updating players times after a config change. (The config also has an option to do this on player login)
- `/eh_whereami`: Lists the current dimensions ID and Name.
